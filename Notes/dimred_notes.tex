Dimensionality reduction is a widely applied set of methods in various data analysis pipelines. It has three main aims:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Describe the data manifold} \\ Parametrise a space that we believe the observed data lives in. This space also serves as generalisation of where we expect future data to show up. Furthermore certain parameterisations - together with information not contained in the dataset - may facilitate interpretation of features.
	\item \emph{Reduce the observation noise} \\ We may separate the data variance into "within-manifold" (signal) and "out-of-manifold" (noise).
	\item \emph{Visualise the concepts discovered in the data} \\ Most collected data nowadays is very high (100+) dimensional, whereas most humans can only conceptualise a few dimensions at once. We have the responsibility to choose the most effective, yet accurate visualisations of the data to communicate features of the data
\end{itemize} 

These goals are often interspersed, yet both the researcher and their audience should be clear on why a dimensionality reduction method was applied, even when the mathematical methodology to achieve each goal may be the exact same.


\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Manifold learning} (e.g. Isomap) \\ Estimate within-manifold distances, predict what data is likely in the future, learn about structure embedded within the data
\end{itemize}
